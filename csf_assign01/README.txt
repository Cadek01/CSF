Rohit Sivananthan, Mason Albert

(written where 'I' is Mason)

Rohit wrote most of fixedpoint_halve.

Together we wrote fixedpoint_add and the beginning of fixedpoint_sub.

I completed fixedpoint_sub.
I wrote fixedpoint_double, fixedpoint_format_as_hex, fixedpoint_create_from_hex, and fixedpoint_negate.
I also wrote the simple field return functions: err, pos/neg over/underflow and is_neg.
I spent a lot of hours debugging and rewriting functions (there were a lot of problems the first time we submitted!)
